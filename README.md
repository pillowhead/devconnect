# devconnect

Following "MERN Stack Front To Back" course in order to build an in depth full stack social network application using Node.js, Express, React, Redux and MongoDB along with ES6+. We will start with a bank text editor and end with a deployed full stack application. 

# What is expected to practice and experiment with:

- Building an extensive backend API with Node.js & Express
- Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Extensive API testing with Postman
- Integrating React with our backend in an elegant way, creating a great workflow
- Building our frontend to work with the API
- Using Redux for app state management
- Creating reducers and actions for our resources
- Creating many container components that integrate with Redux
- Testing with the Redux Chrome extension
- Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku using Git
